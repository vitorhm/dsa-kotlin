### Advantages

- **Fast Insertion**: With prepend and append the operation is O(1). While insert is O(n), the operation is more efficient than an array.
- **Fast Deletion**
- **Ordered**
- **Flexible Size**: Unlike arrays, we don't have a fixed size. Even with dynamic arrays, we need to copy and resize the array once they reach a certain size.

### Disadvantages

- **Slow Lookup**: We need to transverse the nodes.
- **More Memory**
