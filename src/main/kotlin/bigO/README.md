### O(n) - Linear Time

Complexity increase as elements and operations increase on the same amount.

### O(1) - Constant Time

Complexity is constant, no matter how many elements we have.

### O(nÂ²) - Quadratic Time

Every element increased, the operation quadratic increase. Normally this means nested loops for example.
